"Sunday Roundup","POLITICS","This week, if you thought the floor had been reached in the level of debate on the Republican side, you'd be mistaken. An extraordinary Thursday began with Mitt Romney proclaiming ""Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud"" - though he stopped short of joining the growing #NeverTrump movement among Republicans. Hours later, the Republican debate turned into a literal penis-measuring contest, as opposed to the metaphorical ones of previous debates. ""I guarantee you there is no problem,"" said Trump. Perhaps if we allowed them to actually bring out tape measures they wouldn't have to establish their macho credentials through posturing promises of carpet bombing, deportation and torture. But the most extraordinary moment came at the end. After attacking Trump as a fraud and a danger to the country, when asked if they'd support him as nominee all three of the other candidates said, in effect, Yeah, sure, no problem. So much for putting country ahead of party, but apparently one's sense of responsibility is unrelated to hand size."

And the nation crossed the danger threshold of electing the most unstable, unready and extreme president in U.S. history. But not to worry, says Paul Manafort. In an interview with HuffPost's Howard Fineman, the Trump campaign manager assures us Trump will show America he can ""fill the chair."" And that ban on Muslims? ""He's already started moderating on that,"" Manafort said. ""He operates by starting the conversation at the outer edges and then brings it back towards the middle. Within his comfort zone, he'll soften it some more."" The problem is that softened racism, xenophobia and misogyny are no less dangerous. Though the media, which has already retreated to horserace coverage, won't call Trump out, others will. Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of the late Vince Foster, spoke up about Trump's airing of conspiracy theories about her brother's death. ""It is beyond contempt,"" she wrote, ""that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy."" But that's where Trump lives.

It might have been more civil in tone, but it was actually much more frightening than the brawls of previous debates. Gone was the extreme rudeness, but as a result the extreme policies were harder to miss. Asked about torture and targeting civilians, Trump said that while we ""have to obey the laws,"" we should simply ""expand those laws,"" presumably to legalize what's currently illegal. When asked if all 1.6 billion Muslims hate us, he calmly replied, ""a lot of them"" do. Meanwhile, Rubio's answer to climate change was that we can't ""change a law in Washington to change the weather!"" And all suggested that we need to once again send ground troops to the Mideast (what could possibly go wrong?). Finally, when asked about increasing violence at his rallies, Trump blamed it on his supporters' anger about trade deals. And just days later, his canceled rally in Chicago nearly turned into a full-scale riot. Making America great again, indeed. Some have compared this to a reality show. If only that were true.

On Tuesday, Trump said he supports nuclear non-proliferation but also suggested that South Korea and Japan get nuclear weapons of their own (the latter has a pretty good rationale for being nuclear-free). The next night, when asked if women who have abortions should be punished, he replied, ""there has to be some form of punishment."" And no, this wasn't an early April Fool's joke. He walked back the statement the next day, but perhaps this is the reason why three-quarters of women view him unfavorably. But as extreme as the statement was, it's worth noting that mainstream Republican policy has been punishing women seeking abortions for years at the state level - putting up unnecessary roadblocks, mandating outdated procedures and making life as miserable as possible for vulnerable women. Madness indeed."
