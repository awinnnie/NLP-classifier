While these provisions are likely to lead to higher drug prices in the United States, they will have their greatest impact in the developing world. In most developing countries, drugs are far cheaper than in the United States. This is especially the case in India. The country has a world-class generic industry that produces high-quality drugs that typically sell for a small fraction of the price in the United States. The U.S. drug industry desperately wants to eliminate this sort of price gap, which can exceed a ratio of one hundred to one. This should have everyone very worried."

"Sunday Roundup","POLITICS","This week the nation came one step closer to giving itself over to the most dangerous and unstable potential leader in U.S. history, as Donald Trump ""humbly"" accepted the Republican presidential nomination - so humbly, in fact, that he went on to claim that ""I alone can fix"" America. It capped a week of nightly disarray - with Trump more than living up to the ""chaos candidate"" title given to him by Jeb Bush. But what shone through the most in his endless and largely shouted speech was fear - fear of immigrants, fear of diversity, fear of the nation America has become. The key refrain was ""again,"" with Trump promising to make America ""strong again,"" ""proud again,"" ""safe again."" Never mind that America is actually, for instance, very safe - despite recent upticks, crime is still at historic lows. Trump the builder was building a sinister vision of a lost Eden, one that's been taken away by the scary, dangerous Other. And his calls for unity were unity by removal of the other. Trump has rebranded America as a dark, hostile, pessimistic, fearful place. And he only wins by building that place in our minds. But, to paraphrase FDR, we have nothing to fear but the manipulation and cynical nurturing of fear. Trump is, in essence, shorting America. That's his bet. And that's the bet we must reject - not only at the polls but in our minds and hearts."

First, we said adios to 54 years of Cuban isolation policy, with President Obama lifting bans on travel and trade and resuming diplomatic relations. The other goodbye was to The Colbert Report. After nine years and 1,447 episodes, Stephen Colbert signed off in appropriate fashion, with Santa, a unicorn, Abe Lincoln, and a chess match with Death. Then, he was joined by dozens of former guests -- including Big Bird, Henry Kissinger, George Lucas, Katie Couric, James Franco, Cory Booker, Willie Nelson, and myself -- for a bittersweet version of ""We'll Meet Again."" After nearly a decade of Colbert, it's clear that what's truly special about him isn't his amazing wit, incredible timing, or even how staggeringly funny he is; it's his heart. Underneath his blowhard character, his humor consistently came from a place of compassion and truth (in the guise of truthiness) -- exactly what we need in these polarized times. Thankfully, we'll all be resuming ties with Colbert again soon."

If Maine seeks another order, it should be one thanking Hickox for making us safer, since the way to beat Ebola is to stop it in Africa -- not by disincentivizing heroic medical workers willing to help.  With Maine's Paul LePage joining Chris Christie as governors the courageous nurse has used science to vanquish, kids looking for a real superhero to emulate next Halloween should ready their Kaci Hickox costumes."
